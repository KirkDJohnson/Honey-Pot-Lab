<h2>Thoughts</h2>
This lab was extremely fun to setup and run. It was nice to become familiar with setting up a cloud instance and was suprised at how easy it was. Thankfully, using Vultr I used a referral code to get $100 credit so completing the lab was free of charge. The highest was definitely watching the attack map live. I was actually pretty suprised at the fact the highest attacking country was the United States, I would of thought it would be Russia or China. Not only did the lab expland my knowledge of setting up a honeypot instance it also gave me hands on experience with kibana by sorting/filtering the logs that were injested from the honeypot and being able to create tables using different inputs such as source IP, destination port and so on, which would be a great skill to have in a live enviornemnt.
